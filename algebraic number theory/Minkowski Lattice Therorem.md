>[!note] Minkowski Lattice Therorem
>Let $T$ be a subsey of $V$ that is compact, convex, and symmetric in the origin. If $\mu(T) \geq 2^n \mu(D)$ then $T$ contains a point of the lattice other that the origin.

The proof is simple, note that if we move all the points of $T$ to the center, we get that there must be $\alpha,\beta \in T$ such that $\beta-\alpha \in 2\Lambda-(1,\cdots,1)$, using the fact that $T$ is symmetric in the origin, we get that the midpoint of $\alpha,-\beta$ is the point in the lattice we wanted.
