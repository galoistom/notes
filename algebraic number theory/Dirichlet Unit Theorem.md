>[!note] Theorem
>Let $K$ be a number field, we use $U_K$ to denote the group of units in $\mathcal{O}_K$, then there exists $r+s-1$ units $u_1,\cdots,u_{r+s-1}$ and a finite set $\mu(K)$ of units such that for all $u \in U_K$ there exists $m_1, \cdots, m_{r+s-1}$ such that $u=\xi\,u_1^{m_1}\cdots u_{r+s-1}^{m_{r+s-1}}$, where $\xi \in \mu(K)$

We first proof that $U_K$ is finitely generated:
1. Note that for any $M,m$, there are only finitely many $\alpha \in \mathcal{O}_K$ such that $deg(\alpha) \leq M$, and $|\alpha'|\leq m$ for all $\alpha'$ conjugate to $\alpha$.(using this lemma, we can get that if all conjugates of $\alpha$ has absolute value 1, then $\alpha$ is a root of 1.)
2. Note that $\alpha$ is a unit in $\mathcal{O}_K$ if and only if $|Nm(\alpha)|=1$. (The proof is straight forward, just take $\beta=\prod\limits_{\sigma \neq id}\sigma(\alpha)$)
3. Consider $L:K^{\times} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{r+s}$ such that $\alpha \mapsto (\log|\sigma_1(\alpha)|,\cdots,\log|\sigma_{r+s}(\alpha)|)$ and $H$ is the subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{r+s}$ such that $x_1+\cdots+x_r+2(x_{r+1}+\cdots+x_{r+s})=0$ for all $x \in H$. Then evidently the image of $L:U \rightarrow H$ is a lattice in $H$ and the kernel is finite.

Now we need to proof that the rank of the lattice is $r+s-1$.
1. We first proof that we can choose $x \in \mathcal{O}_K$ such that $|\sigma_jx|<1$ for all $j \neq i$. We first let $\frac{1}{2} \leq Nm(x) \leq 1$, then $x\cdot \mathcal{O}_K$ is a lattice, take $T$ compact  convex and symmetric around the origin with sufficiently large volume. We then use [[Minkowski Lattice Therorem]] then we get that there are always $\gamma \in T \cap x \cdot \mathcal{O}_K$, using the fact that $Nm(\gamma)$ is bonded, we know that there are only finitely many different $\gamma \cdot \mathcal{O}_K$, so we denote them as $\gamma_1,\cdots, \gamma_t$. Then if $x \cdot \sigma(\gamma)\mathcal{O}_K \in T$, we have $(\gamma)=(\gamma_i)$ for some $i$, so there exists a unit $\epsilon$ such that $x \cdot \epsilon \in \sigma(\gamma_i^{-1})T$, note that $T'=\sigma(\gamma_1^{-1})T \cup \cdots \cup \sigma(\gamma_t^{-1})T$ is totally bonded, thus we can choose a unit $\epsilon$ such that $x \cdot \sigma(\epsilon)$ is bounded uniformly in $x$.
2. By the above discussion, we can now let $x$ with sufficiently large coordinates except $x_i$, and guarantee that $Nm(x)=1$, then we get an $\epsilon_i$ such that $|\sigma_j(\epsilon_i)|<1$ for all $j \neq i$, consider the matrix with i-th row $(l_1(\epsilon_i), \cdots, l_r(\epsilon_i),2l_{r+1}(\epsilon_i), \cdots, 2l_{r+s-1}(\epsilon_i))$ where $l_i=log|\sigma_i|$, we know that $a_{ij}<0$ for $i \neq j$, and $\sum\limits_i a_{ij}>0$ so the matrix is obviously invertible, hence the lattice is a full lattice.
