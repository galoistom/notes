# The p-adic Numbers
>[!note] Definition
>Fix a prime number $p$. A *p-adic number is a formal infinite series*: $a_{0} + a_{1}p + a_{2}p^{2} + \dots$, where $0 \leq a_{i} < p$ for all $i = 0,1,2,\dots$ The set of all p-adic integers is denoted by $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$.

In fact, we have $a\equiv a_{0}+a_{1}p+\dots+a_{n-1}p^{n-1} \pmod{p^{n}}$. The idea of p-adic numbers come from the Taylor expansion of $f = \frac{g}{h} \in \mathbb{C}(z)$. 

In analogy with the laurent series $f(z)=\sum_{v=-m}^{\infty}a_{v}(z-a)^{v}$, we now extend the domain of p-adic integers in to that of the formal series $$\sum_{v=-m}^{\infty}a_{v}p^{v} = a_{-m}p^{-m}+ \cdots + a_{-1}p^{-1} + a_{0} + a_{1}p + \cdots$$, where $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $0\leq a_{v}<p$. Such series we call simply *p-adic numbers* and we write $$
