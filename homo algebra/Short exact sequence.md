>[!note] Short exact sequence
>Let $A$ , $B$ , $C$ , be three $R-module$ , a short exact sequence $0 \longrightarrow A \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} B \stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow} C \longrightarrow 0$ must satisfies the following conditions:
>1. $f$ is injective, $g$ is surjective
>2. $Ker(g)=Im(f)$


We say that a short exact sequence $0 \longrightarrow A \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} B \stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow} C \longrightarrow 0$ split if there exists $j:B \rightarrow A$ and $h:B \rightarrow C$ , such that $jf=id_A,\, gh=id_C, \, fj+hg=id_B$ , i.e. B is more or less the same as $A \oplus C$ (cf.[[First extension group]]).

By using this idea and abusing the notions, we can see $B$ as a kind of "sum" of $A$ and $C$, further notions will be varified in [[Grothendieck group]]
