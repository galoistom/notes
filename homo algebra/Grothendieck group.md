>[!note] Grothendieck group
>Consider an abilian categroy, its Grothendieck group is the "smallest" abilian group $G$ with a morphism such that for every [[Short exact sequence]] $0 \longrightarrow A \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} B \stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow} C \longrightarrow 0$, one heve $[B]=[A]+[C]$ in which $[X]$ denote the image of $X$ in $G$. To be more specific, for every group $G'$ satisfying the former contition, there is a natural surjective homomorphism $G' \rightarrow G$.

As we have said in [[Short exact sequence]], Grothendieck group represents the additive property contained in short exact sequences and is the addition in the group is the same as direct sum if $R$ is a field(as every $R-module$ will then be projective module)

## Example: 
in the categroy of finitely generated modules of a dedekin domain $A$ is isomorphic to $Cl(A) \oplus \mathbb{Z}$.
