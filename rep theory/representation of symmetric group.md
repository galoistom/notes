Let $a_\lambda$ be the sum of elements in $S_n$ that permute each row of the daigram and $b_\lambda$ be the sumt of elements in $S_n$ that premute each column of the diagram. Then $a_\lambda \mathbb{C}[S_n] b_\lambda$ is an irrducible representation of $S_n$, moreover ever irrducible representation of $S_n$ is isomorphic of the above representation.
